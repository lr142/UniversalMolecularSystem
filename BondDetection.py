# Automatically detect chemical bonds based on element types and distances.
# It should be implemented in a more advanced way, for example through machine learning...
# I'll work on this later...

# The class BondRules and the function MainAsXYZ2Mol2 are from legacy code, just for a reference.
# The class Bond is an older version of the Bond Class, which should also be rewritten.

# The [bond_rule_file] is a txt files (in csv format) which defines bond rules, they can include multiple lines,
# each line is like below:
# AtomType1 AtomType2 MinBondLength MaxBondLength BondType
# For example in the following lines
# C,O,1.2,1.6,1
# C,O,1.1,1.2,ar
# The above two lines ask the program to judge any two C, O atoms that are within 1.2 Angstrom(A) but at least 1.1 A
# apart form a aromatic bond, any two C, O atoms that are at least 1.2 A apart but within 1.6 A from each other form
# a single bond. Rules are checked in reverse order, which means that a rule appears later in the file overrides rules
# that appeared earlier, if it contradicts with the earlier rules.
# Other specifications include:
# 1. In each rule, the order of names of two atoms doesn't matter, meaning "C O 1.2 1.6 1" and "O C 1.2 1.6 1" are
#    exactly the same.
# 2. The 3rd parameter of this program, [bond_rule_file], is optional. There is a default bond rule file, named
#    "xyz2mol2.default.bond.rules", comes together with the xyz2mol2.py program and read by the program each time
#    it runs, to recognize some commonly encountered bonds in organic molecules. However a user defined [bond_rule_file]
#    can be supplied if some bonds are not recognized or special rules apply. Remember that rules in [bond_rule_file]
#    will override the default rules, if there are contradictions. Futhermore, rules appear later supersede previous one.
# 3. The 5th segment of each line in bond_rule_file defines the bond type, it can be any string that conforms with the
#    TRIPOS mol2 file format specification, such as 1, 2, 3, ar, am, etc. More information can be obtained from
#    www.tripos.com.
