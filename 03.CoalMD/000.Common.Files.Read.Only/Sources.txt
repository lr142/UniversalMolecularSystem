1. FuchsSandoff.mol2 Given1.mol2 and Given2.mol2 are drawn and exported from Materials Studio
2. *.csv are forcefield types of each atom and are manually written
3. fuchsSandoff.lt, given2.lt, and given1.lt are generated from LTFileFromMOL2.py in 001... Folder. methane.lt, tip4p.lt, tip4p2005.lt are hand written.
4. all files in water.and.ch4.cells are built by Packmol, which are 100Å * 100Å * 100Å cells filled with CH4 or H2O
5. CoalCell.xsd are a 100Å * 100Å * 100Å (approximately) cell of coal molecules, built by Amorpheous Cell module of Materials Studio
